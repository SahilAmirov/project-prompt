## üìã About The Project

Struggling to provide complete context to AI models like **GPT-4**, **Gemini**, **Claude**, etc about your codebase? Pasting files one-by-one is tedious, and you often hit token limits or include irrelevant "noise" like `node_modules` or `bin` folders.

**Project Context Scraper** is the solution. This simple GUI tool scans your entire project, intelligently filters out everything you don't need, and generates a single, clean `.txt` file. This file contains your directory structure and all essential source code, perfectly formatted to be used as a prompt.

Just copy, paste, and ask your question. Get better, more accurate help from your AI assistant in seconds.
